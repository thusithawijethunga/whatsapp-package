WhatsApp Notification Channel for Laravel Applications

## Introduction

This package provides a custom notification channel for sending notifications via WhatsApp in Laravel applications. It integrates with the WhatsApp API to send messages to specified recipients.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require promoxp/whatsapp
```

## Configuration

After installing the package, you need to configure your WhatsApp API credentials in your Laravel application. Publish the configuration file using the following Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=whatsapp-config
```

This will create a `config/whatsapp.php` file where you can set your `appkey` and `authkey`.

## Usage

To send a WhatsApp notification, you can use the `WhatsAppNotification` class:

```php
use Promoxp\WhatsApp\Notifications\WhatsAppNotification;

$user->notify(new WhatsAppNotification('YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID'));
```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID'` with the appropriate template ID for your WhatsApp message.
